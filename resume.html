                    I'm an asset as an employee because I'm smart, creative, driven, and I'm a team player.
                    I want to hear what others need from my work to make sure it's serving its larger purpose, I'm always open to constructive feedback, and I'm flexible and willing to learn and change as needed.
                    I also love to keep my head down and focus on my work, digging into the details and making sure my work is bulletproof.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    In this transition, I'm looking for a position with work-from-home/anywhere potential, a flexible schedule, and ample learning and growth opportunities.
                    I know on the other end of the bootcamp I will still have so much to learn so I would love to work for a company which is excited to teach me more.
                    And I would love to work for a company with great benefits and an excellent company culture.
